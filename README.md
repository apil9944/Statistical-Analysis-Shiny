**Chi-squared Goodness of Fit Tests for Uniformity**
*Tests whether the data comes from a Uniform distribution*

**Chi-squared Test for Independence**
*Tests if two variables can be considered independent when sampling from one population.*

**One sample t-test**
*Tests if the mean of a variable is significantly different to the true or hypothesised population mean.*

**Two sample t-test for unequal population variance**
*Tests if the population means of two samples are significantly different, assuming unequal popluation variances.*
